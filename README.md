This project template combines React, TypeScript, Node, Webpack.
Change name here, in .env, and in package.json

## Run Client

```sh
npm run client
```

This runs the client hot-loaded with webpack-dev-server.

## Run Server

```sh
npm run server
```

This runs a Node server watched by ts-node-dev which does not need to compile
through running ts-node on every change.
